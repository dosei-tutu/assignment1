    <h1> Bodegas vs. Supermarkets
      <p> Food Insecurity in the Bronx </<p>
      <p> Bronx, NY, October 7th 2021 </p>
    </h1>
    <article>
      <p> The Bronx is known for having food deserts and being one of the most food insecure areas in not only NYC but also the world. The pandemic certainly did not help things as many fellow Bronx residents lost their jobs. According to Feed America, they project that food insecurity in the Bronx will rise to 40%. Most people in the Bronx rely on their delis and bodegas which have limited healthy options in comparison to a supermarket. A lot of supermarkets are unfortunately not in reasonable commutable distances and are not always affordable. There is a citywide initiative to try and stock bodegas and delis with fresh produce and healthier food options for a population that does not always have access to those things. Places such as Hunts Point which has 20 bodegas to one supermarket would benefit from that.</p>
